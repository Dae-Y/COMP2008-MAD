Objectives

Understand the difference between SQLite and Room.
Implement an entity class in Java/Kotlin that represents a database table.
Use a Data Access Object (DAO) to perform CRUD operations.
Integrate Room into an Android application and inspect database data.

Used @OptIn(ExperimentalMaterial3Api::class), experimental features in Jetpack Compose, like Material3 APIs.
The Jetpack Compose team marks certain APIs as experimental to indicate that they might change in the future.

To manage multiple fragments in Kotlin, I think I should use APIs or Navigation, NavHost, NavController etc.

Material2 and Material3 refer to two different versions of Google's Material Design guidelines and the associated component libraries.
Material2 Released: Around 2014 with the launch of Android 5 (Lollipop).
Material3 Released: In 2021 with Android 12.
